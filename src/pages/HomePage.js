        I'm a passionate software engineer with a journey that’s taken me
        through some pretty exciting challenges and accomplishments in the tech
        world. My career kicked off with a six-week bootcamp where I built a
        project that laid the foundation for my love of problem-solving and
        innovation.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        One of the highlights of my career was working in the agriculture tech
        industry, where I dove deep into the world of machine learning. I worked
        on models that predicted crop performance by genotype and geolocation—a
        project that required a solid understanding of farm tech, statistics,
        and a lot of grit. It was tough, but the sense of pride I felt after
        seeing the impact of our work on real-world farming decisions was
        totally worth it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I also had the chance to work on a project that unblocked entire
        engineering teams by creating a dockerized version of a platform
        API—basically, a test environment in a box. This tool allowed engineers
        to spin up realistic test APIs locally, making development and testing
        way more efficient.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        In the fintech world, I played a crucial role in developing core APIs,
        creating automation for complex data processes, and optimizing payment
        integrations that directly impacted customer experience. I’ve led
        projects like deposit change management and even tackled tricky issues
        like resolving job crashes in cloud environments.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        My work isn’t just about writing code—I've been heavily involved in
        engineering sales, consulting, and mentoring. I thrive in environments
        where I can bring big ideas to life, establish best practices, and lead
        teams through agile processes. Whether it's mentoring client engineers,
        optimizing workflows, or collaborating across teams, I’m all about
        making tech work better for everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        I’ve always believed that great software development is a blend of
        technical skill and deep collaboration. Whether it’s working with
        data-heavy systems or refining user experiences, I’m here to make a
        difference through code, innovation, and a little bit of fun along the
        way.
